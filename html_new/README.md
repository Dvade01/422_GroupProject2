Try not to run the code much because its gonna cost a shitload of money if it uses a few of the API's too much


Also comment out the following functions on ip_geolocation.py

def get_ipgeolocation_geolocation(ip):

def get_ipstack_geolocation(ip):

these have limited requests

I have added a ip_usage.txt file that says how many we have used


##TODO
So at the moment I tried to make it so that the software would open up as an application so that hornof could be lazy and run the code without having
to install any dependencies, however I could not get the executable to function properly so thats our main issue right now, hopefully you frontend guys can 
put it into our UI anyways and make it work as an executable like hornof probably wants.
